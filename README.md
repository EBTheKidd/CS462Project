CS 462 â€“ Sliding Window Protocols Team Project

### Ideas:

  I think we can probably use the sendfile.cpp as a base (we can convert it to c if necessary)
  
    Its already setup with a text-based GUI with server/client selection and command line argument parsing, as well as md5sum and filesize methods for files being sent/recieved. I think that this will be easy to convert to a sliding-window simulation.

  It would probablby be best to contain everything in a single file (as sendfile.cpp does) for workflow purposes.
